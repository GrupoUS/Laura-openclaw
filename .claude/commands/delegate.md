# /delegate - Explicit Delegation Protocol

$ARGUMENTS

<command-instruction>
Before delegating, you MUST complete the Pre-Delegation Declaration:

```
Agent selected: [agent name]
Why this agent: [match between agent specialty and task domain]
Skills to load: [list from .claude/skills/]
Skill evaluation:
  - [skill-1]: INCLUDED because [reason]
  - [skill-2]: OMITTED because [reason]
Expected outcome: [concrete deliverable]
```

Then structure the delegation prompt with ALL 7 sections:

1. TASK: [atomic, specific - one action per delegation]
2. EXPECTED OUTCOME: [concrete deliverables with success criteria]
3. REQUIRED SKILLS: [skills to invoke]
4. REQUIRED TOOLS: [explicit whitelist]
5. MUST DO: [exhaustive requirements - nothing implicit]
6. MUST NOT DO: [forbidden actions]
7. CONTEXT: [file paths, patterns, constraints]

After delegation completes, VERIFY:

- Does it work as expected?
- Does it follow existing codebase patterns?
- Did the agent follow MUST DO and MUST NOT DO?
