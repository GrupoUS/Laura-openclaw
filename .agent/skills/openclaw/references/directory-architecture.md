# OpenClaw Directory Architecture

OpenClaw stores configurations, extensions, and autocomplete scripts across multiple directories within `~/.openclaw`.

## `~/.openclaw/config`
This directory holds configuration JSON files for various external integrations and API settings used by OpenClaw agents and plugins.
- **API Keys & Webhooks**: Files like `asaas.json`, `kiwify-token.json`, `kiwify-webhook.json`, `typebot.json`, `inworld.json` store secrets and API credentials for third-party services.
- **Provider Auth**: Services like `google-workspace` use `google-credentials.json` and `google-token.json` for OAuth flows.
- **Usage**: Agents and plugins read from these files deterministically. Always ensure these files are properly formatted JSON and backed up if making manual edits.

## `~/.openclaw/extensions`
This directory holds configuration for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and other locally hosted extensions.
- **`.mcporter`**: A core extension directory containing `mcporter.json` (and backups like `mcporter.json.bak`).
- **`mcporter.json`**: This file configures the MCP servers available to OpenClaw. It dictates the `command`, `args`, and `env` variables for servers like `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`, `@upstash/context7-mcp`, and `@mseep/linear-mcp`.

## `~/.openclaw/completions`
This directory contains shell autocomplete scripts generated by the OpenClaw CLI.
- **Supported Shells**: Includes `openclaw.bash`, `openclaw.zsh`, `openclaw.fish`, and `openclaw.ps1`.
- **Usage**: These scripts are typically sourced in the user's shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to enable tab-completion for `openclaw` CLI commands.
