## 🚀 Major Updates & Fixes

### SDR & Commercial Flow

  - Focus on **Formation/Specialization**.
  - **Routing Rules:**
    - New Leads -> Lucas (Exclusive).
    - Qualified Leads -> Lucas/Erica (Round-robin).
    - No Response -> Lucas/Erica (Recovery).
  - **Contact Preference:** Now explicitly asking and flagging if lead prefers Call or WhatsApp.
